Welcome to Towalink
===================

Towalink is a multi-site connectity solution. It connects sites using point-to-point VPN tunnels via any available access networks. The default topology is full-mesh, but any other topology can be configured easily. It builds on proven technology like BGP routing and WireGuard. Reliable, flexible, straight-forward.

.. CAUTION::
   This is a young project. It is already being used on production sites. But be aware that there are still rough edges and that it thus might not suit your needs and expectations.
