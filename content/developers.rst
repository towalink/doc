Developers
**********

Towalink is an open source solution. It intends to become a powerful, open alternative to proprietary, closed solutions. We started with two developers/engineers and aim at creating a vibrant community of users and contributors.

Links to Important Resources
============================

The following public resources are very relevant to the Towalink project:

* Website: https://www.towalink.net
* Documentation: https://towalink.readthedocs.io
* Github: https://github.com/towalink/

Help Wanted
===========

The following topics are considered the most desirable areas for your contributions:

* | REST API
  | The Towalink Controller can be configured using the "tlm" command line interface as of now. The existing functionality should also be exposed via a REST API. Proposed framework: Flask.
* | web frontend
  | A user-friendly web frontend for configuring the Towalink installation would be nice. It should access the REST API mentioned.
* | monitoring improvements, alerting
  | Monitoring and alerting in a pre-configured and user-friendly way is considered very important. Help to improve on that.
* | documentation improvements
  | Any means to improve the project documentation are welcome (corrections, enhancements, tutorials/howtos, success stories, etc.).
* | spread the word
  | Towalink is not well known to the public yet. Help to spread the word about its existence, e.g. on websites dealing with related topics.

We are also looking for companies that are willing to become reference customers. This shall be for mutual benefit. It should be "friendly customers" that are open to help improve on Towalink. We imagine a feedback loop in which we jointly monitor the experience with Towalink in the company environment and aim at iteratively improving Towalink to suit the practical needs. 

Contributing
============

When intending to contribute to the Towalink code repositories, please discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of the repository before making a change. 

We use a meritocratic community model. The more you get involved and contribute, the more can you influence the direction of the project.

Please follow our code of conduct in all your interactions with the project.

How to report a bug
-------------------

Write an email for now; we will switch to a bug tracker in future.

Please include expected behavior, experienced behavior, and any information needed to reproduce the issue. In case you solved the issue for you, please tell what you did or what code you changed.

Style Guide / Coding conventions
--------------------------------

For Python: If in doubt, follow the PEP8 style guide. Note that we use a few exceptions, e.g. we do not enforce line length restrictions any more.

Testing
-------

There are no automated tests yet that cover the end-to-end solution. Please ensure that any code changes you propose are thoroughly tested.

Some modules have unit tests. Please make sure that any code changes are tested with these. Please also extend the test coverage to cover new features/etc. of your changes.

How to submit changes
---------------------

You may merge a pull request in once you have the sign-off of another developer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the reviewer to merge it for you.

How to request an "enhancement"
-------------------------------

Write an email if you like to suggest a feature to a project but that is not a bug/problem with the existing code.

In case you request an enhancement for business needs, consider donating to support the development.

Recognition model
-----------------

Contributions will be listed.

Copyright/license
-----------------

By your contribution you provide the rights to use your code according to the projects license. This is mostly the AGPL but you also grant permission to the project owner to release the code under different licenses in the future.
